In recent years it has become more and more frequent to use network models going beyond simple directed/undirected and weighted/unweighted networks, to capture the complexity of old and new fields of application of network analysis. Multilayer networks are an example of such models, extending graphs with the concept of layer, that allows us to represent a multitude of scenarios from the different types of ties we find in a multiplex network, to different types of actors, to different temporal snapshots of the relations between the same group of actors. Multilayer network models can themselves be enriched with additional features, such as attributes and edge probabilities, with the aim of describing real phenomena in more detail.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Multilayer and feature-rich networks allow us to introduce new research questions (and corresponding social network analysis measures and methods). For example, instead of asking how central an actor is, we can focus on the role of the different layers in determining the centrality of the actors. Second, existing social network analysis concepts do not always have a clear corresponding extension in complex networks. For example, it is still unclear how communities spanning multiple layers should look like, or how different features should contribute to the definition of communities, or how to effectively visualise multilayer and feature-rich networks, e.g. layers, features or modes, in the same sociogram. In addition, multilayer networks allow to use multiple types of layers (e.g., in temporal multiplex networks), which requires the joint application of methods developed for simpler models (e.g., only temporal, or only multiplex).

This session focuses on recent advances in the analysis of multilayer and feature-rich networks, either in terms of new research questions, or new methods, or new applications. More specifically, topics for this session include but are not limited to:

• New models for multilayer and feature-rich networks, or comparison of alternative models; 
• Measures for multilayer and feature-rich network; 
• Community discovery in multilayer and feature-rich networks; 
• Multilayer and feature-rich network embedding; 
• Visualisation of multilayer and feature-rich network; 
• Multilayer and feature-rich network simplification (e.g., sampling, filtering, flattening, projections); 
• Applications; 
• Software.

Collaboration networks attract a lot of attention in many scientific domains. The session focuses on presenting methodological developments and novel applications related to the session topics. 

Special interest is on the analysis of collaboration networks in presence of complex data structure, and on collaboration data extraction and empirical data collection. 

The organizers solicit the submission of abstracts dealing with the following topics: 
• Academic and scientific networks; 
• Analysis of collaboration networks in economics, cultural and social environments; 
Co-authorship networks; 

Collaborative innovation networks; 

Community detection in collaboration networks; 

Dynamics and evolution patterns of collaboration networks; 

Empirical data collection; 

Mixed methods for data collection and data analysis.
