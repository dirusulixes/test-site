<summary><b>Organised Session 01: Advanced Methods for Multilayer and Feature-Rich Networks and Their Applications</b></summary>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

In recent years it has become more and more frequent to use network models going beyond simple directed/undirected and weighted/unweighted networks, to capture the complexity of old and new fields of application of network analysis. Multilayer networks are an example of such models, extending graphs with the concept of layer, that allows us to represent a multitude of scenarios from the different types of ties we find in a multiplex network, to different types of actors, to different temporal snapshots of the relations between the same group of actors. Multilayer network models can themselves be enriched with additional features, such as attributes and edge probabilities, with the aim of describing real phenomena in more detail.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Multilayer and feature-rich networks allow us to introduce new research questions (and corresponding social network analysis measures and methods). For example, instead of asking how central an actor is, we can focus on the role of the different layers in determining the centrality of the actors. Second, existing social network analysis concepts do not always have a clear corresponding extension in complex networks. For example, it is still unclear how communities spanning multiple layers should look like, or how different features should contribute to the definition of communities, or how to effectively visualise multilayer and feature-rich networks, e.g. layers, features or modes, in the same sociogram. In addition, multilayer networks allow to use multiple types of layers (e.g., in temporal multiplex networks), which requires the joint application of methods developed for simpler models (e.g., only temporal, or only multiplex). 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This session focuses on recent advances in the analysis of multilayer and feature-rich networks, either in terms of new research questions, or new methods, or new applications. More specifically, topics for this session include but are not limited to:
<p>&nbsp;</p>

• New models for multilayer and feature-rich networks, or comparison of alternative models; 
• Measures for multilayer and feature-rich network; 
• Community discovery in multilayer and feature-rich networks; 
• Multilayer and feature-rich network embedding; 
• Visualisation of multilayer and feature-rich network; 
• Multilayer and feature-rich network simplification (e.g., sampling, filtering, flattening, projections); 
• Applications; 
• Software.

<summary><b>Organised Session 03:  Ecosystem of Entrepreneurs</b></summary>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Hetty Wenxian Sun**, Greenwich Business School (w.sun@gre.ac.uk) 
**Petros Ieromonachou**, University of Greenwich 
**Aaron Tan**, University of Greenwich 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

As a network, ecosystems are present and thriving in the world in various forms. This track looks specifically at entrepreneurial ecosystems which relies on people, the culture they bring in and the way they interact with each other. People, as one of the most central parts to support entrepreneurial ecosystems, plays many different roles: policymakers, lawyers, community leaders, investors and so on, and indeed, “entrepreneurship is a community sport” (Whitters, 2014). Great businesses are built by great people, and without high-skilled workers, they would not have surfaced. To continuously supply the entrepreneurial talent, the ecosystem would need to attract, engage and nurture people, especially young people, with skills that could allow them to be more responsive to the business requirements.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

A diverse culture is the fertilised soil for ecosystems, which enables the production of a broad range of entrepreneurial solutions to issues present in the world and society. This leads to initiatives to solve wider problems such as climate change, global warming and personal security, as well as reducing the unemployment rate, improving public services and boosting mental health. A diverse team often brings in better results (Rock & Grant, 2016) and hence truly drives the growth of the ecosystem. Economic progress is the result of innovations (Holcombe, 2007) and market share is constantly taken by new businesses and ideas. An ecosystem should allow entrepreneurs to experiment with new business models and technologies to achieve growth and during which, plenty of interactions among entrepreneurs, policymakers, investors and competitors will provide a rich context for social network analysis.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Sample topics
The EU Social Networks Conference Ecosystem of Entrepreneur track encourages and welcomes researchers who recognise the difference of ecosystem elements and take particular interest in examining their interactions in the entrepreneurial world contributing to the following themes (but not limited to):
<p>&nbsp;</p>

• Cultivate ecosystem
• Cultural and interactive aspects of relationship with policymaker
• Human capital in the entrepreneurial ecosystem
• Building community capacity for ecosystem development
• Entrepreneurship education from an ecosystem perspective
• Millennial entrepreneur and talent
• Innovation-driven entrepreneurship ecosystem
• The role of open innovation
• Investment ecosystem for start-ups
• Global ecosystem from a financial and technological perspective
• Competition and cooperation in entrepreneurial ecosystems

<summary><b>Organised Session 04:  Family Networks and Personal Networks Through the Life-course</b></summary>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Vera de Bel**, University of Turku, Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (vera.debel@utu.fi)
**Thomas Leopold**, University of Cologne 
**Marlène Sapin**, LIVES & FORS, University of Lausanne 
**Eric Widmer**, LIVES, University of Geneva) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Life-course trajectories and transitions are intertwined within the complex webs of family and personal relationships. These networks may provide individual network members with resources, supporting them through life-course events and transitions. However, these networks, depending on their composition or the pattern of interactions, do not only exert a positive influence on the individual members of the network. Family and personal networks may also cause stress or strain on the individual and the network level. In addition, family and personal networks change over time, which may have consequences on the access to resources and may for example affect individual network members’ well-being, behaviour, and life chances. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This session invites papers on personal and family networks during the different stages of the life course. Papers focusing on the transition into adulthood, family formation, union dissolution, transition to retirement, and ageing are encouraged to be submitted, but studies on other life-course changes are also welcome. Quantitative as well as case studies on specific normative or non-normative life events are also of interest to this session.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Important insights into social networks can be obtained with the help of longitudinal observation designs. Such designs can be of a varied nature. Panel data is the structure used traditionally for self-reported networks; regular time series and time-stamped data can be obtained from official or automatic records; but this does not exhaust the types of longitudinal network designs. Corresponding to these differences in data collection, a variety of longitudinal methods of analysis have been developed, such as continuous-time actor-oriented and tie-oriented models for panel and time series data, network autoregressive models for time series at regular intervals, and network event models for data with a fine-grained time resolution. Some of these methods are based on actor-oriented models, others on tie-oriented models.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This session will be open to methodological as well as applied presentations about models for network dynamics. Papers can have a mathematical, statistical, theoretical, or empirical subject-matter focus, as long as they are relevant for empirical social science.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<summary><b>Organised Session 07:  Multiplex Networks and Individual Outcomes in School</b></summary>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The importance of multiplexity is increasingly recognised in (educational) network research. While research into the effects of peer networks has traditionally focused on a single network dimension at a time, most commonly on friendship, this approach has been shifting lately. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

A wave of studies in recent years has showed how multiple forms of social ties emerge between students and affect a variety of their outcomes. Relevant networks include personal relations such as liking or “friendly” ties, spending free-time together, studying together, dislike, conflict, victimisation, and romantic ties. Besides these, interpersonal perceptions appear to have an impact on student behaviour and outcomes as well: such as perceptions about the status, social roles, or personality of peers. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that the emergence and change of the various network dimensions is interconnected. Multiplex social networks jointly influence individual outcomes, such as academic achievement, school attitudes, mental and physical health, political attitudes, and so on. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This section invites presentations which explore the importance of multiplex networks for individual outcomes in educational settings. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Particularly (but not exclusively), we would be happy to hear about work that focuses on: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

• Data collection techniques for multiplex networks in school; 
• Statistical methods that are specific to multiplex networks in school; 
• Empirical data analyses and results involving the evolution of multiplex networks in school; 
• Empirical data analyses and results involving the relationship of multiplex networks and individual outcomes in school. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The list is not exhaustive: we are very much open to a wide range of studies on the topic of multiplexity in schools. We hope to bring together a diverse set of research projects and facilitate discussion and collaboration between scholars interested in educational network research.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The use of network analysis in bibliometrics has a long tradition, which dates back to the 1960s. However, while the analysis of bibliometric networks has become extremely popular in the last decades, there are still some areas that have received less attention; in particular, the construction of bibliometric networks, the use of different data sources, and the impact of bibliometric methods. Moreover, novel research topics constantly emerge in different scientific disciplines, and their evolution requires a robust mapping process. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This session is dedicated to methodological advancements, empirical applications, and proposals on the use of novel software and tools for applying network analysis in bibliometric studies. We welcome contributions exploiting the role of network analysis in bibliometric studies, including (but not limited to): 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

• Network structures in bibliometric studies; 
• Authors’ and papers’ centrality; 
• Co-authorship, co-occurrence, and network metrics; 
• Modularity, sub-groups, and clusters; 
• Cross-country collaborations; 
• Bibliographic database journal coverage; 
• Editorial board networks; 
• Actors’ attributes in scientometrics; 
• Network visualization.

The analysis of sport data is becoming truly helpful for recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of individual players and collective behaviors of teams. Using such information is possible to make better decisions and organize the strategy to achieve greater success both in terms of sport results and economic aspects. Therefore, the rise of sport analytics tools mixed with the availability of data allow the spread of innovative methodologies in a broad range of sports. In this context, relational data are also arising.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The proposed session focuses on contributions regarding network analysis in sport data. Between the possible topics, network analysis may help to unveil the key elements regarding tactics and/or team strategies in team sports. Furthermore, connections between teams (e.g. trading and exchanges) and/or federations cover an important role and may contribute to sport results. The search of appropriate methodologies to deal with those data remains an open issue. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The audience of interest may include experts in statistics, operations research, machine learning, scientific computing, economics, sports management, and sport science interested in expanding these topics in a network perspective. Audience members will become aware of the most current thinking on common problems of interest in network modeling or analysis of sports data. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The session welcomes empirical, methodological and/or theoretical contributions exploiting the role of Network Analysis in sports, including (but not limited to): 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

• Local network structures; 
• Temporal networks; 
• Network indicators and sport outcomes; 
• Signed networks; 
• Multimodal networks; 
• Multilayer networks; 
• Complex networks. 

Innovative approaches of network analysis for popular team sports (e.g., football, basketball, and volleyball) as well as original applications based on less known sports are also welcome.

<summary><b>Organised Session 10:  Networking Historical Past</b></summary>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Anna Collar**, University of Southampton 
**Maria Carmela Schisani**, University of Naples Federico II 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The network perspective has currently reached a paradigmatic position in some fields, like sociology. Moreover, during recent years we have seen a steady increase of publications and works on a number of economic, social, cultural and religious aspects that have attempted to apply network analysis to the past world, in particular to explain their interconnections. Network analysis attracted scholars of human past for their potential in investigating human relationships, visualising and exploring their structures among different archaeological and historical sources. Archaeological and historical data sources pose challenging opportunities to network analysts and network scientists. World-Systems Analysis has especially emphasized the importance of understanding interactions and interrelationships between different peoples or inside the same human group. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The aim of this session is twofold. Firstly, we want to work towards a specific historical and archaeological network analysis, drawing on the relational thinking of network theory and incorporating archaeological and historical sources critique and reasoning. Secondly, we want to present new findings and approaches within historical and archaeological network research, and promote contacts between the various disciplines that approach past phenomena using methods derived from network analysis or network science. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The session invites contributions from various disciplines applying the methods of formal network analysis and network science to the study of the historical research. The contributions will answer questions such as: how can we detect change in human networks change over a long timeframe? How can literary and historical sources and material culture help in answering this question? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

We welcome submissions about any period, geographical area and topic, which might include but are not limited to: economics, politics, military issues, religion and science, interpersonal relations, kinship, cultural networks, artistic transmission, material and immaterial connections, migration, networks extracted from texts, geospatial or temporal networks, big data and data collection from fragmentated sources.

<summary><b>Organised Session 11:  Networks and Crime</b></summary>

The importance of social networks for analyzing and explaining criminal behavior has been widely recognized. A wide range of illegal activities, such as drug trafficking, human smuggling, or terrorism requires coordination among offenders to be successfully performed. It is not surprising, therefore, that the network perspective on crime has recently gained popularity, both among academics and law enforcement practitioners, as it captures the essence of such activities. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

However, the study of criminal networks is challenging. Data collection is difficult in situations where subjects themselves aim not to be detected. Gathering first-hand evidence on such phenomena is therefore extremely difficult, and in some cases dangerous. Scholars have thus relied on police data, such as arrests, or investigative evidence, such as electronic surveillance or phone records, to build an empirical base for their analysis. A second challenge is methodological, i.e. matching/developing the right statistical models based on the specificities of criminal networks to adequately test criminological theories, allowing to move beyond descriptive network measures. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This session is dedicated to innovative research at the intersection of network analysis and criminology. We welcome a wide range of submissions focused on criminal networks, including methodological, theoretical, and empirical studies. Topics may include: collection of criminal network data, testing theories of co-offending, victimizations and violence using network data, case studies of specific criminal groups, and statistical modelling tailored to the complexities of criminal network data. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Keywords: covert networks, criminology, methodological innovation, co-offending, violence, organised crime, illegal markets, criminal networks, terrorist networks.

The networked nature of organizations, and the organizational contexts of network dynamics create a complex ecosystem where individuals, groups, units, and other organizations are entangled and recursively active. Such entanglement shapes organizations in a dynamic way and affects their outcomes at multiple levels. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This session aims to bring together studies on organizational networks addressing antecedents, dynamics, and implications of the cross-level processes leading to the emergence of relations and outcomes at various levels. Submissions can refer, but are not limited, to the following areas of research: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

• Micro-foundations of organizational networks: how individual characteristics and cognition affect the emergence of network structures and how these network structures affect individuals; 
• Dynamics of organizational networks: how network structures at various levels co-evolve and affect one another, as well as organizational processes and outcomes; 
• Time-dependence in organizational networks: how organizational networks at various levels change at different paces over time; 
• Overlap and interplay between social and other kinds of networks within and across organizational settings: how organizational networks are affected by the affiliation of individuals, or organizations to events or contexts. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

We welcome both theoretical and empirical contributions addressing various aspects and implications of organizational networks research.
