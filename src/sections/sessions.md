<summary><b>Organised Session 01: Advanced Methods for Multilayer and Feature-Rich Networks and Their Applications</b></summary>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

In recent years it has become more and more frequent to use network models going beyond simple directed/undirected and weighted/unweighted networks, to capture the complexity of old and new fields of application of network analysis. Multilayer networks are an example of such models, extending graphs with the concept of layer, that allows us to represent a multitude of scenarios from the different types of ties we find in a multiplex network, to different types of actors, to different temporal snapshots of the relations between the same group of actors. Multilayer network models can themselves be enriched with additional features, such as attributes and edge probabilities, with the aim of describing real phenomena in more detail.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Multilayer and feature-rich networks allow us to introduce new research questions (and corresponding social network analysis measures and methods). For example, instead of asking how central an actor is, we can focus on the role of the different layers in determining the centrality of the actors. Second, existing social network analysis concepts do not always have a clear corresponding extension in complex networks. For example, it is still unclear how communities spanning multiple layers should look like, or how different features should contribute to the definition of communities, or how to effectively visualise multilayer and feature-rich networks, e.g. layers, features or modes, in the same sociogram. In addition, multilayer networks allow to use multiple types of layers (e.g., in temporal multiplex networks), which requires the joint application of methods developed for simpler models (e.g., only temporal, or only multiplex). 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This session focuses on recent advances in the analysis of multilayer and feature-rich networks, either in terms of new research questions, or new methods, or new applications. More specifically, topics for this session include but are not limited to:
<p>&nbsp;</p>

• New models for multilayer and feature-rich networks, or comparison of alternative models; 
• Measures for multilayer and feature-rich network; 
• Community discovery in multilayer and feature-rich networks; 
• Multilayer and feature-rich network embedding; 
• Visualisation of multilayer and feature-rich network; 
• Multilayer and feature-rich network simplification (e.g., sampling, filtering, flattening, projections); 
• Applications; 
• Software.

**Giuseppe Giordano**, University of Salerno
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Collaboration networks attract a lot of attention in many scientific domains. The session focuses on presenting methodological developments and novel applications related to the session topics. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Special interest is on the analysis of collaboration networks in presence of complex data structure, and on collaboration data extraction and empirical data collection. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The organizers solicit the submission of abstracts dealing with the following topics: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

• Academic and scientific networks; 
• Analysis of collaboration networks in economics, cultural and social environments; 
• Co-authorship networks; 
• Collaborative innovation networks; 
• Community detection in collaboration networks; 
• Dynamics and evolution patterns of collaboration networks; 
• Empirical data collection; 
• Mixed methods for data collection and data analysis.

<summary><b>Organised Session 04:  Family Networks and Personal Networks Through the Life-course</b></summary>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Vera de Bel**, University of Turku, Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (vera.debel@utu.fi)
**Thomas Leopold**, University of Cologne 
**Marlène Sapin**, LIVES & FORS, University of Lausanne 
**Eric Widmer**, LIVES, University of Geneva) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Life-course trajectories and transitions are intertwined within the complex webs of family and personal relationships. These networks may provide individual network members with resources, supporting them through life-course events and transitions. However, these networks, depending on their composition or the pattern of interactions, do not only exert a positive influence on the individual members of the network. Family and personal networks may also cause stress or strain on the individual and the network level. In addition, family and personal networks change over time, which may have consequences on the access to resources and may for example affect individual network members’ well-being, behaviour, and life chances. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This session invites papers on personal and family networks during the different stages of the life course. Papers focusing on the transition into adulthood, family formation, union dissolution, transition to retirement, and ageing are encouraged to be submitted, but studies on other life-course changes are also welcome. Quantitative as well as case studies on specific normative or non-normative life events are also of interest to this session.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Important insights into social networks can be obtained with the help of longitudinal observation designs. Such designs can be of a varied nature. Panel data is the structure used traditionally for self-reported networks; regular time series and time-stamped data can be obtained from official or automatic records; but this does not exhaust the types of longitudinal network designs. Corresponding to these differences in data collection, a variety of longitudinal methods of analysis have been developed, such as continuous-time actor-oriented and tie-oriented models for panel and time series data, network autoregressive models for time series at regular intervals, and network event models for data with a fine-grained time resolution. Some of these methods are based on actor-oriented models, others on tie-oriented models.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This session will be open to methodological as well as applied presentations about models for network dynamics. Papers can have a mathematical, statistical, theoretical, or empirical subject-matter focus, as long as they are relevant for empirical social science.

<summary><b>Organised Session 07:  Multiplex Networks and Individual Outcomes in School</b></summary>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The importance of multiplexity is increasingly recognised in (educational) network research. While research into the effects of peer networks has traditionally focused on a single network dimension at a time, most commonly on friendship, this approach has been shifting lately. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

A wave of studies in recent years has showed how multiple forms of social ties emerge between students and affect a variety of their outcomes. Relevant networks include personal relations such as liking or “friendly” ties, spending free-time together, studying together, dislike, conflict, victimisation, and romantic ties. Besides these, interpersonal perceptions appear to have an impact on student behaviour and outcomes as well: such as perceptions about the status, social roles, or personality of peers. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that the emergence and change of the various network dimensions is interconnected. Multiplex social networks jointly influence individual outcomes, such as academic achievement, school attitudes, mental and physical health, political attitudes, and so on. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This section invites presentations which explore the importance of multiplex networks for individual outcomes in educational settings. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Particularly (but not exclusively), we would be happy to hear about work that focuses on: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

• Data collection techniques for multiplex networks in school; 
• Statistical methods that are specific to multiplex networks in school; 
• Empirical data analyses and results involving the evolution of multiplex networks in school; 
• Empirical data analyses and results involving the relationship of multiplex networks and individual outcomes in school. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The list is not exhaustive: we are very much open to a wide range of studies on the topic of multiplexity in schools. We hope to bring together a diverse set of research projects and facilitate discussion and collaboration between scholars interested in educational network research.

<summary><b>Organised Session 08:  Network Analysis and Bibliometrics</b></summary>

The use of network analysis in bibliometrics has a long tradition, which dates back to the 1960s. However, while the analysis of bibliometric networks has become extremely popular in the last decades, there are still some areas that have received less attention; in particular, the construction of bibliometric networks, the use of different data sources, and the impact of bibliometric methods. Moreover, novel research topics constantly emerge in different scientific disciplines, and their evolution requires a robust mapping process. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This session is dedicated to methodological advancements, empirical applications, and proposals on the use of novel software and tools for applying network analysis in bibliometric studies. We welcome contributions exploiting the role of network analysis in bibliometric studies, including (but not limited to): 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

• Network structures in bibliometric studies; 
• Authors’ and papers’ centrality; 
• Co-authorship, co-occurrence, and network metrics; 
• Modularity, sub-groups, and clusters; 
• Cross-country collaborations; 
• Bibliographic database journal coverage; 
• Editorial board networks; 
• Actors’ attributes in scientometrics; 
• Network visualization.
